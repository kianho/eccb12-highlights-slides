### Description

These are slides for my seminar about my trip to ECCB'12 held in Basel,
Switzerland (September 2012). I gave this talk at the Victorian Life
Sciences Computation Initiative (VLSCI) in Melbourne on August 16, 2013
to share my experiences with other academics and to thank the VLSCI and
NICTA for funding my conference travel. The duration of this talk is
5-10 minutes.

### Notes

The photos of the conference were obtained from the
[official ECCB'12 gallery](http://eccb12.org/gallery).
